A basic http request consists of:
    A verb (or method)
        Has a meaning
        Is idempotent or not
        Is safe or not
        Is cachable or not
    A resource (or endpoint)

Understanding the common HTTP verbs:

GET: As the name suggests, read from a resource
     Retrieve a specific resource from the server, or a list of resources

POST: Creates a resource or trigger a data handling process
      Create a new resource on the Server

PUT: Fully updates/replaces an existing resource or create a resource
     Update a Resource on ther Server, providing the entire resource

PATCH: Partially updates a resource
       Update a resource on the Server, providing only changed attributes.

DELETE: Delete a resource
        Remove a Resource from Server


RPC (remote call procedure):
    Endpoint contains the name of operations you want to invoke
    Generally only uses GET and POST HTTP verbs

GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
    'data': 'anId',
    'anotherdata': 'another value'
}


REST
    Expose data as resource.

Get /someresource/anId

PUT /someresource/anId
{
    "anotherdata": 'another value'
}

REST approach is data based, RPC approach is operation based.

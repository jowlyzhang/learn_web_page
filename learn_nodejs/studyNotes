I was learning this content a long time ago and all this directory contains is example
code I typed before. Coming back today, these materials is only making vague sense to
me. It's hard to rememeber all the details but having a general idea of all the concepts
might be a necessary take away for all the learning. So I would keep some study notes
everytime I tried it out.

I would say Node.js is a library that makes server side programming with javascript much
easier. And it looks like it's more than a library, because except the functionality
if offers for asynchrous resource accessing, event-driven handling, easy scalabilty.
Node.js also offers package management that reuse other packages, host on the npm website,
installing packages globally, locally. It also has an interactive interpreter that makes
prototyping and tring out pieces of code easier which uses the google V8 javascript engine.


Node.js makes it especially easy to implement concurrency in server applications, which is
rare for  many server side programming languages. Nodejs is mostly used to build network
programs, like PHP, but, PHP is blocking, and nodejs is non blocking.


The express thing is a web framework for fast development with nodejs.

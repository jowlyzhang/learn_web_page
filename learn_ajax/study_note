Ajax is a client side technique for doing asynchrnous communication with Web server.
It allows event driven event handlers to be executed asynchrously after sending
a request to the server not blocking other operations.

It also dynamically update elements in the DOM, not requiring complete refress of
the whole page, which offers better user experience.

It is based on XMLHttpRequest that is able to send XML formated request over HTTP
protocol. It is also capable of sending other type of formats.

Database access using Ajax is very convenient. It certainly faces the same type
of security issue as the other web technologies.

It relies on javascript, css, and not necessarily supported by all browsers.

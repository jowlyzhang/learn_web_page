Layered networking model:
=========================

Physical layer: electrical signals, light pulses, radio waves
Protocol: Not really protocols, standards for voltage, frequencies, other physical properties.

Link layer: ethernet, 802.11a/b/gn token ring
Protocol: Handle concurrent accesses to the physical medium, direct traffic.

Network layer: Internet Protocol(IP)
Protocol: Handler traffic half way through the world

Transport layer: TCP, UDP
Protocol: Pass on your message to the right process

Application layter: HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, telnet, ssh
Protocol: How to interpret message.

A browser refresh click on a user computer gets converted to
-> a http request, which gets converted to
-> a data package in with tcp protocol, which get sent to a web server via
-> ip protocol, which is physically trasferred and routed by
-> ethernet and physical layer,
after reaching the web server
-> tcp protocol pass it to the process by the port number
-> http protocol unwraps request from data packet.


HTTP sessions:
==============

Http session is a sequence of network request-response transactions. An http client initiates
request by establishing a transmission control protocol(TCP) connection to a particular port
on a server(typicially port 80, occasionally port 8080). An http server listening on that port
waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status
line and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource.

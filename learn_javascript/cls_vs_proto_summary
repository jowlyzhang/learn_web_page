There are some graphic representation of this class based vs prototype based
inheritance thing.

As we can see from this experiment, prototype based oop has the power
to achieve the same purpose as class-inheritance based oop. As a matter
of fact, the whole class-based implementation in javascript is based on
the prototype mechanism + `new` + constructor function.

Dynamically adding functions to a prototype adds functionality to all
objects created using that constructor. However, prototype based
implementation is more intuitive.
